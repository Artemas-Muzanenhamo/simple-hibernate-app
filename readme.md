# Hibernate

## What is an ORM

- Object-relational mapping
- technique for converting data between incompatible type systems 
using object-oriented programming languages.
- Translates Objects to tables in our databases automatically so we
can focus on working with objects.

Hibernate is a persistence technology based on the idea of Object-relational
mapping.

## What is Hibernate?

- It's an open source ORM that is able to map Java Objects to most/any
relational database.
- Framework that allows us to specify configuration to use to connect
with our database and to specify the way which our Java objects 
should be mapped to relational tables.
- Creates SQL that is able to perform CRUD operations from the database.
- It presents data from the data as Java objects that we can use and 
manipulate and save back to the database.
- Originally created in 2001 by Gavin King.
- Created to be a better alternative in Java from EJB2.
