# Hibernate

## What is an ORM

- Object-relational mapping
- technique for converting data between incompatible type systems 
using object-oriented programming languages.
- Translates Objects to tables in our databases automatically so we
can focus on working with objects.

Hibernate is a persistence technology based on the idea of Object-relational
mapping.
